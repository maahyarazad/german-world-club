## Notes

1. The "Context: what already exists" section and FR-030/FR-032 name existing modules, files and
   build configuration on purpose. About half of this feature already exists, and the spec has to
   say which half, or planning would rebuild it. The requirements themselves describe behaviour.
2. Offer publishing scope resolved 2026-09-24: trigger + minimal offer detail screen only.
